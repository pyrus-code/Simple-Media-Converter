## Motivation

This application was born from a simple need: a straightforward, offline audio converter that respects user privacy, unlike many online tools.

What began as a small personal project quickly transformed into an experiment in AI-assisted development. I was curious to see how far I could push AI, evolving a basic script into a complete, feature-rich program. The result is an application where over 95% of the code was generated by AI, turning a simple idea into a powerful tool.

I believe this app can help others who need to convert audio or video files in a simple and completely offline manner.
